# Genome-analysis
Analysis of the bat genome to identify genes that correlate to the development of wings on forelimbs. A project for the course Genome analysis (1MB462) at Uppsala university 2018.

## Project goal
This study aimed to replicate the analyses performed by Eckalbar et.al. in their 2016 paper "Transcriptomic and epigenomic characterization of the developing bat wing", which in turn aspired to understand the specific molecular events that underlie formation of wings in bats at separate stages of embryonic development. In the original study this was done by analyzing both genomic and transcriptomic data from the species Miniopterus natalensis, more specifically by performing a series of analyses with three specific goals:

* To obtain a draft genome of Miniopterus natalensis through WGS genome assembly.

* To perform Transcriptomics of forelimbs and hindlimbs at 3 separate stages (CS15, CS16, CS17)

* To perform ChIP-seq of both the H3K27me3 (active regions) and H3K27ac (repressed regions) and study histone modification at the 3 stages.

However due to the limited amount of time and resources and limited amount of experience on my part, this replicative study focused mainly on a select few of the analyses performed in the original study and on subset of the genome. The study consists of 10 specific analysis steps:

1. Reads Quality Control

2. Reads preprocessing

3. Genome assembly

4. Transcriptome assembly

5. Genome assembly evaluation

6. Annotation

7. Mapping of RNA

8. Read counting

9. Differential expression analysis
